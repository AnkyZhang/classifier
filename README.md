# classifier
Classify images with Googlenet using caffe.

Hopefully easy to follow python code for classifying images using the Goooglenet example that comes with caffe. Results are displayed in the console and saved as images with titles such as: "Class 690, 98.2%, oxcart.jpg"  The image below, classfied as an oxcart with a probability of 98.2%, was generated with [ImageFromClass](https://github.com/chipgarner/ImageFromClass) using the class for an oxcart.  It does not look like an oxcart to me, although there is an ox.
